This file contains information about the tidy data set called "TidyDataCourseProject.txt", created by the script "run_analysis.R" included in this repository.

"TidyDataCourseProjet.txt" is a data frame with	180 observations(rows) of  68 variables (columns).

The 180 observations correspond to data of each activity (6 in total: Walking, Walking-upstairs, Walking-downstairs, Sitting, Standing, and Laying) performed by each of the subjects who participated in the experiment (30 in total).

The names of the 68 variables, a brief explanation of their content, and the type of the variable of this data frame are the following:

* Subject
